Optimized AI Command Prompts (Simplified and Expanded)

Step 1: Screening Sustainability Reports

"1. Task Identification: ""Screen the given sustainability report and identify specific criteria as per the provided instructions."""
2. Detailed Criteria Screening:
"""Does the report explicitly state alignment with ISSB Standards? Look for keywords like 'ISSB Standards,' 'IFRS SI', 'IFRS S2', 'ISSB Framework,' or references to 'International Sustainability Standards Board.'"""
"""Identify any mentions of the reporting standards or frameworks being followed. Create a list of all standards/frameworks mentioned, such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, or ISSB."""
"3. Data Extraction: ""For each standard or framework identified, note any details about how the company claims alignment or implementation."""



Step 2: Providing a Definition for Screening

"4. Definition Guidance: ""Use the provided definition of ISSB alignment to aid in determining whether the report aligns with ISSB Standards."""
"Use the definition provided:
'Currently aligning with the ISSB Standards means a company referenced the ISSB in the context of its current alignment in reporting with the sustainability-related disclosure requirements in ISSB Standards.'"""



Step 3: Enhancing AI Training for ISSB Analysis

"5. ""Identify phrases indicating alignment with ISSB Standards. Examples include: for Training AI:"
"""This report adheres to ISSB Standards, as it includes detailed disclosures on sustainability materiality and financial impact analysis."""
"""Our company complies with ISSB Standards, integrating TCFD recommendations as a basis for sustainability disclosures."""
'We have started to align our reporting with the ISSB Standards.'
"'This year, the company also considered the new ISSB Standards in completing this report and included relevant indicators.'"

"Expand examples to include variations in phrasing, such as:"
'Our disclosures have been enhanced by integrating elements of the ISSB Standards.'
'The report aligns with the guidelines set out by IFRS S1 and IFRS S2.'
"'We have adopted the ISSB framework for sustainability reporting.'"""

Step 4: Iterative Refinement
"6. Iterative Refinement: ""After screening, re-evaluate the criteria for ISSB alignment if discrepancies are found in the reports. Adjust the analysis method to ensure consistent interpretation of standards across multiple reports."""


Step 5: Screening Classifications/ Structuring Output Data in a Table
7. Prompt for Standards/Frameworks Reported Against:
"""Check if the company reports align with the standards/frameworks mentioned in the report'' (e.g., ISSB, GRI Standards, CSRD). Use the concept definition approach:"
Identify whether the company explicitly claims alignment.
"Look for context showing how the standard/framework was considered or implemented."""

"8. Output Structure: ""Organize the findings in a table with the following columns:"
Standard/Framework Reported Against
Description of Alignment or Mention
Evidence or Key Statement from Report
Page Number or Section Referenced
Actual Alignment Verified
"Other Frameworks Mentioned (e.g., OECD Guidelines, UN Principles)."""

| Standard/Framework | Description of Alignment or Mention                 | Evidence or Key Statement                         | Page Number/Section |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
"| ISSB               | Partially aligned; mentions adherence to TCFD      | 'We align with ISSB through TCFD integration.'   | Page 12, Sustainability Overview |"
"| GRI                | Fully aligned; references GRI Standards explicitly | 'This report follows GRI Standards: Core option.'| Page 8, Reporting Framework |"

Step 6: Advanced Analysis
10. Command Prompt for Additional Context Analysis:
"""Analyze the report for detailed evidence of alignment with frameworks. Check for:"
Specific actions taken to align with the standards.
Indicators or metrics referenced from the standards/frameworks.
"Explicit mentions of guidelines or principles used in reporting."""

11. Prompt for Insight Extraction:
"""Extract key statements and contextual evidence supporting or contradicting alignment with any mentioned standards/frameworks."""
